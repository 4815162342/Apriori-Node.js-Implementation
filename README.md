# Apriori Node.js Implementation
Frequent itemset mining method Apriori implemented in the Node.js environment.

Apriori, documented in Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikant in their [1994 research paper] (http://www.vldb.org/conf/1994/P487.PDF), is a powerful algorithm for mining frequent itemsets from transactional records. I implimented it in JavaScript's Node.js environment.
